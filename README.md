# SocialCops-App-Data-Cleaning-
This is an evaluation project for a job application to an NGO in India. The goal was to infer missing location information on survey forms.
Formatting is rough because this was done under time constraints, but I believe the answer to be correct.
Problem statement: 

 A client of SocialCops was using Collect for household Survey in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. It turns out in some responses, data         collectors have missed entering the Assembly Constituency Names (AC), Mandal Names and Village Names in the relevant field. Fortunately, the client has maintained a database of all the tablets being deployed in different villages in different dates. Attached is an excel file <Tab_Villages_Mapping.xlsx> containing two sheets: Sheet 1 one contains a list of around 21,000 responses for which AC, Mandal and Village Names are missing and Sheet 2 contains a list of tablets in use in different villages in different dates. Can you get the missing Village Names? [Hint: You may not get names of all the missing villages!]
 
 My code is in Prob1.R and FindPossLocs.R. The given data is in Tab_Villages_Mapping.xlsx as originally given. My solution is Problem1Solution.csv.
